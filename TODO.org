* todo

** Bugs

*** TO-DO Multiple args

**** TO-DO allow multiple files for file uploads. Multiple files as last arg. :big:

**** TO-DO Ability to send db or files to multiple servers at same time? :big:
: sink db put stag:prod:dev <file>
: sink file put stag:prod:dev <path>

*** TO-DO sink view -e should validate
    When editing config, make temp version of config and validate
    yaml after saving.

*** TO-DO Single

**** TO-DO With 'single' make sure the correct rsync is being used
- sink info -e cannot find emacs on osx

**** TO-DO When using =single= ignore the "ask overwrite" yaml settings.

**** TO-DO Quiet/silent flags
- quiet: output "Succcess", server and base filename
  - eg: Success, prod, index.twig
  - eg: [Success] prod:.../dir/dir/index.twig
  - eg: [Success] username@servername:/dir/dir/index.twig
  - eg: [Success] PROD username@servername:/dir/dir/index.twig
- silent: no output at all.
- or use -q and -qq for quiet and silent.

** New Features

*** MAYBE DB download details
Save extended info about a db download in a text file with same name
as gziped file.
: sink db pull --extended-info="Long descriptive text"
: sink db info [GZ-FILE]

*** TO-DO DB put, use tab completion for filename

*** MAYBE use click contrib: help-colors

*** MAYBE use click contrib: click-option-group?

*** MAYBE use click contrib: click-plugin for laraval forge support?

*** diff

**** TO-DO One file/all servers:
sink diff 'all' path...= compare one file on all servers at one time?
or download all and group by differences:
[A] LOCAL, dev, vagrant
[B] stag
[C] prod, mamp
Compare LOCAL to [B, C]: ?

**** MAYBE Some kind of diff report for all files that are different.
Using info from rsync's itemize-changes?

**** TO-DO Sink difftool setting in sink.yaml.  Allow different settings for different platforms.
difftool:
- osx: <path>
- linux: <path>

**** DONT-DO sink diff multiple files?

*** Exclusions

**** TO-DO Allow server specific exclusions

**** TO-DO Allow use of exclusion files via rsync's =--exclude-from=FILE=
- Generate on the fly from a exclusions stored in a single yaml
  file?  hierarchical?
- Store in separate files using a naming convention?
  sink-prod.exclude, sink-stag.exclude?

*** TO-DO flags to hide command & command output
-q --no-command, -qq --no-output, -qqq both?
--silent -s, for both?

*** progress bar

**** TO-DO Add flag for pv in sink.yaml so it can be used from the server
Try =mysqlpump= if it's on the server.  It has =--watch-progress=

**** TO-DO Check for pv locally before using

*** MAYBE Option to upload a bashrc file and execute it when sshing.
For locked down servers that don't allow editing .bashrc.

*** MAYBE Custom db pull filename
Allow a custom name.
| short | field       |
|-------+-------------|
| %u    | user        |
| %n    | db name     |
| %s    | server name |
| %d    | short date  |
| %D    | long date   |
| %t    | tag         |
Adding :u to tag will uppercase it and the extentions will be added by sink.
- "%n-%s-%d" :: dbname-servername-20-01-30.sql.gz
- "%n__%s:u__%d" :: dbname__SERVERNAME__20-01-30.sql.gz
- "%n--%s:u--%D" :: dbname--SERVERNAME--20-01-30-10:30:15.sql.gz

Optionally for the date, expose full python date string options..?

*** TO-DO When downloading db don't overwrite existing file.
If the user is using a short date name for the db pull, and they pull
more than once in one day, the filename will be the same.

*** TO-DO Enable tab complete on osx.  Part of setup.py?

*** TO-DO Test/run setup.py

*** MAYBE If no files to transfer
If there are no files to transfer, give an explicit notice to the user in the success notice.
eg: =[Success (no files to transfer)]=
Maybe there is a return code from rsync to determine this.
