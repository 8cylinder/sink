Sink is a web development project management tool for the command
line.  The main things it does are:

- Sync files between servers.
- Sync databases between servers.
- Diffs between a local file and a remote file.
- Central storage (sink.yaml) for all website data; passwords,
  usernames, urls, etc.
- An API to access stored data from other scripts.
- Run a check on each server; urls, db, ssh.

By default when a command is run such as =sink file put=, it outputs
only the commands that would be run.  The user can then examine or
copy and paste the commands to modify them.  If they look correct use
the =--real= flag to run the command "for real".

The commands displayed are the actual bash commands that are used.
They are run using Python's subprocess module.

It has been developed on Ubuntu and is untested on any other platform.
The remote server must be Linux.

A project is defined by putting a sink.yaml file in the projects root dir.

*** sink.yaml
Running =sink init= will output to the console a basic config file.  If
any arguments are passed they will become the names of servers.  The
output can be redirected to a file.

#+begin_src bash
sink misc init > sink.yaml
sink misc init dev stag prod > sink.yaml
#+end_src

Nothing is required except for the project name.

#+begin_src yaml
project:
  name: "projectname"
#+end_src

The standard yaml structure is a project section and a servers
section.  There are many fields that can be added.  Also extra fields
can be added that sink doesn't use but can be accessed via the API.

#+begin_src yaml
project:
  name: "projectname"
servers:
  dev:
    root: /var/www
  prod:
    root: /var/www
#+end_src
