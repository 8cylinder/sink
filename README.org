Sink is a web development project management tool for the command
line.  The main things it does are:

- Sync files between servers.
- Sync databases between servers.
- Atomic deploys.
- Diffs between a local file and a remote file.

One of its main philosophies is that every command is a bash command
(run via Python's subprocess module) that is displayed in the
terminal.  The user has to explicitly execute the command with the
=-r= (=--real=) flag.

It has been developed on Ubuntu and is untested on any other
platform.  The remote server must be Linux.

It considers a project root to be the dir that has the =sink.yaml=
config file.  This file holds all the information to make the commands
work.

*** sink.yaml
Running =sink init= will output to the console a basic config file.  If
any arguments are passed they will become the names of servers.  The
output can be redirected to a file.

#+begin_src bash
sink misc init > sink.yaml
sink misc init dev stag prod > sink.yaml
#+end_src
